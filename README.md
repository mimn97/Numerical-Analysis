# Numerical Analysis Final Project - Predictor Corrector Method

This is created for final project for the course Numerical Analysis in Spring 2020. 
The purpose of this project is to examine Predictor-Corrector methods for Initial Value Problems (IVPs). 

## PC.py 

A Python Numpy program for implementing several types of Predictor-Corrector methods
